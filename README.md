#### This project was planned to be built in 3 primary parts:
  1. Build out API
    - Build out API to allow for users and images relationship, as well as AWS implimentation for image hosting.
    - Apply relationships that allow for creation and deletion of images and to tie them to user accounts
    - Update image and date updated record implimented as well.
  2. Development of Client
    - Build out user authentication functionality including sign-up, sign-in, change-password, etc.
    - Apply semantic code to section out front end develpment and seperate user functionality.
    - Build out image functionality to view, delete and update. Also allows to tag images with multiple comma seperated attributes.
  3. Reduce code quantity by refactoring for callback usage
    - Continuous improvement for refactoring of code-blocks to allow for better legibility and future development.

### Development Process

Development split amongst 4 primary team members. Scope of project created numorous conflicts as features were built and imported to master code block, creating some repetition in content build. Team may have been too large or project scope to small.
